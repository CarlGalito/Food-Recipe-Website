        <div class="recipe-container">
            <i><h3>Ingredients:</h3></i>
            <ul>
                <li>✔ 4 pieces of chicken (drumsticks, thighs, or breasts)</li>
                <li>✔ 1 cup of flour</li>
                <li>✔ 1 tsp salt </li>
                <li>✔ 1/2 tsp pepper</li>
                <li>✔ 1/2 tsp paprika (optional)</li>
                <li>✔ 1/2 tsp garlic powder (optional)</li>
                <li>✔ 1/2 cup buttermilk (or regular milk if you don't have buttermilk)</li>
                <li>✔ 1 egg</li>
                <li>✔ Oil for frying (vegetable or canola oil)</li>
            </ul>
    
            <i><h3>Instructions:</h3></i>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the chicken: </li>
                Pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels to remove any moisture.
                <li>Make the flour mixture:</li>
                In a bowl, mix together the flour, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder.
                <li>Prepare the egg wash:</li>
                In a separate bowl, beat the egg and mix it with the buttermilk.
                <li>Coat the chicken:</li>
                Dip each piece of chicken into the egg wash, making sure its fully coated.
                Then, coat it with the flour mixture, pressing the flour onto the chicken to cover it completely.
                <li>Heat the oil:</li>
                Pour enough oil into a frying pan to cover the chicken halfway.
                Heat the oil over medium-high heat. You can test the oil by dropping a little flour into it – if it sizzles, it's ready.
                <li>Fry the chicken:</li>
                Carefully place the chicken pieces in the hot oil. Dont overcrowd the pan – fry in batches if necessary.
                Fry the chicken for about 10-15 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Make sure the chicken is cooked all the way through (an internal temperature of 165°F or 74°C).
                <li>Drain the chicken:</li>
                Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the oil and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
                <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
                Serve your crispy fried chicken with your favorite sides like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or fries!
