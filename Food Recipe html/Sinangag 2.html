        <h2><strong>Sinangag (Garlic Fried Rice) with itlog Recipe</strong></h2>
        <div class="recipe-container">
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>✔ 2 cups cooked rice (preferably cold, day-old rice works best)</li>
                <li>✔ 4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>✔ 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>✔ 2 eggs</li>
                <li>✔ Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>✔ Optional: Chopped green onions for garnish</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Rice:</li>
                If you're using leftover rice, break up any clumps so the grains are separated.
                <li>Cook the Garlic:</li>
                Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the minced garlic and cook it for about 1-2 minutes until it becomes fragrant and golden brown. Be careful not to burn the garlic.
                <li>Scramble the Eggs:</li>
                Push the garlic to the side of the pan and crack the eggs into the empty space. Scramble them with a spatula until fully cooked.
                <li>Fry the Rice:</li>
                Add the cooked rice to the pan and stir everything together. Make sure the rice is well-coated with the garlic and eggs. Stir-fry for about 3-5 minutes until the rice is heated through and slightly crispy.
                <li>Season:</li>
                Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir well to evenly season the rice.
                <li>Serve:</li>
                Transfer the rice to a serving dish and garnish with chopped green onions if desired. Serve it as a side dish or with your favorite main course.
            </ol>

                In a pan, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the sliced longganisa and cook until browned and crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the longganisa from the pan and set it aside.
